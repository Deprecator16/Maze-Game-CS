# Maze-Game-CS
This is a randomized maze game. Upon running the program, you will play as a red dot navigating its way through a maze. Use either WASD or the arrow keys to move in whichever direction you want, going through the maze, step by step. The objective is to make it to the end of the maze, at the green "endPoint" square! Good luck and have fun!
